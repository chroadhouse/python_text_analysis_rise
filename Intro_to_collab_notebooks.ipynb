    "- Interactive Learning Environement: Allowing you to write small bits of code at a time and instantly see what they do \n",
    "- Machine Compatability: Even before programming, setting up different editors and ensuring compatibale versions of programming langauages can lead to cause many problems. \n",
    "- Can be run in the cloud: With us working in collab it means that all our code actually runs on Google's machines on the cloud, meaning that older machines are unlikley to cause any issue. #"
